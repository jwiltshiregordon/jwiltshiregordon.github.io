<h1>John D. Wiltshire-Gordon</h1>
<p>
For the academic year 2020-2021, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Williams College.  Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Wisconsin, Madison working with Jordan Ellenberg.  Fall of 2016 I was a post-doc at ICERM.  I am currently applying for jobs in academia and in industry.   Here is my CV.
</p>

<p>
I study the representation theory of categories with applications in algebraic topology.  I like configuration spaces, category theory, and computer algebra.
</p>

<p>
The prototypical situation: a category C acts on a collection of spaces X_c by transformations, and so the induced maps on homology form a C-module.  My thesis, completed in 2016 at the University of Michigan under David Speyer, gives theory and algorithms for working with C-modules.  I explain how to write a C-module using a presentation matrix and how to use that matrix to compute numbers associated to the module.
