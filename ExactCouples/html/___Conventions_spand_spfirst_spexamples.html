      <div>
        <div>
          <p><b>Encoding an exact couple as a module for a ring</b></p>
          <p>An exact couple is a pair of R-modules E and A together with maps A --> E --> A and A --> A with the conditions that</p>
          <p>im(A --> E) = ker(E --> A)</p>
          <p>im(E --> A) = ker(A --> A)</p>
          <p>im(A --> A) = ker(A --> E).</p>
          <p>In this package, exact couples are encoded by an action of R[e,f] on the direct sum $M = A \oplus E$, where e acts by the maps  A --> E --> A, f acts on A by the map A --> A, and on E by 0.  A ring of the form R[e,f] form is called a 'couple ring' and the degrees of its variables must satisfy the conditions in <a title="accepts certain rings of the form R[e_r,f_r], and installs Page, isEvenDegree, and isOddDegree" href="_expect__Couple__Ring.html">expectCoupleRing</a>.</p>
          <p>The module E is the &quot;page&quot; and the module A is the &quot;auxiliary&quot;.  Typically, E and A occupy disjoint sets of degrees, termed &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;.  The terms of the spectral sequence live in even degrees, since they come from the page.  The auxiliary data lives in odd degree.</p>
          <p><b>Constructing exact couples</b></p>
          <p>Exact couples arise in algebra any time a chain complex $C=(C,d)$ carries a self map $f : C \to C$.  Setting $A = H_* C$ to be the homology of $C$, and $E=H_* C(f)$ to be the homology of the mapping cone of $f$, we have a long exact sequence</p>
          <p>... —-> A —-> E —-> A --f--> A —-> ...</p>
          <p>defining the maps in the exact couple.</p>
          <p>The all-purpose method <a title="builds an exact couple from a R[d,f]/d^2-module" href="_exact__Couple.html">exactCouple</a> accepts as input C considered as an $R[d,f]/d^2$ module. Note that the action of $d$ and $f$ is encoded by the ring action.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To build exact couples by hand, use <a title="initializes generating classes for an exact couple" href="_declare__Couple.html">declareCouple</a>, and check your work with <a title="whether something is homogeneous (graded)" href="/Applications/Macaulay2-1.16.99/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_is__Homogeneous.html">isHomogeneous</a> and <a title="accepts a module if it encodes an exact couple" href="_expect__Exact__Couple.html">expectExactCouple</a>.  For the usual long exact sequence induced by a map of complexes, use <a title="finds the long exact sequence associated to a map of R[d]/d^2-modules" href="_long__Exact__Sequence.html">longExactSequence</a>. Once you have an exact couple, <a title="builds the derived couple of an exact couple" href="_derived__Couple.html">derivedCouple</a> produces another, as we now explain.</p>
          <p><b>Derived couples</b></p>
          <p>Every exact couple determines a new exact couple by the formulas $A' = im(f)$ and $E' = ker(e^2)/im(e^2)$.  The maps $A' \to E' \to A'$ are induced by $e$, and the map $A' \to A'$ is induced by $f$.  There is a wrinkle, however: the map $A' \to E'$ factors $A' \to A / ker(f) \to E'$, making use of the first isomorphism theorem.  Some degree confusion can result.  Indeed, the inclusion $A' \subseteq A$, which is induced by the identity, is a degree 0 map; in contrast, the projection $A / (ker f) \to A'$, which is induced by $f$, has the same degree as $f$ itself.  This forces the inverse map $A' \to A / ker(f)$ to have degree $-deg(f)$.</p>
          <p>If we had taken A' to be the coimage of f instead of the image, this would have resulted in different degrees.  So either of these conventions would have an asymmetry: an unjustified preference for image or coimage.</p>
          <p>We use neither convention.  Instead, we place A' exactly halfway between (image f) and (coimage f).  This has the effect of giving the comparison maps $A \to A' \to A$ the same degree, namely, $(degree f)/2$.  (This division-by-two accounts for the requirement in <a title="accepts certain rings of the form R[e_r,f_r], and installs Page, isEvenDegree, and isOddDegree" href="_expect__Couple__Ring.html">expectCoupleRing</a> that the degree of $f$ be even.)</p>
          <p>The new degrees can be expressed in terms of the old:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>$ degree f' = degree f$</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>$ degree e' = (degree e) - (degree f) / 2$.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The resulting ring $R[e',f']$ is the derived couple ring of $R[e,f]$; it acts on the derived couple, and can be obtained using <a title="forms the ring that acts on a derived couple" href="_derived__Couple__Ring.html">derivedCoupleRing</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><b>How to determine $deg(e)$ and $deg(f)$ in your example</b></p>
          <p>Suppose you have in mind a particular spectral sequence of $R$-modules, starting on page k, and you want to program its exact couple.  What degrees should you use for the couple ring $R[e_k,f_k]$?</p>
          <p>Think about the degree of $D_k$, the differential on the starting page.  This tells you the degree of $e_k$:</p>
          <p>$deg(e_k) = deg(D_k)$.</p>
          <p>Now think about the degree of $D_{k+1}$, the differential on the next page.  This lets you compute the degree of $f_k$:</p>
          <p>$deg(f_k) = 2 * deg(D_k) - 2 * deg(D_{k+1})$.</p>
