      <h1>Serre spectral sequence in homology -- exact couple associated to a fibration</h1>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p><b>Homology Serre spectral sequence for the Hopf fibration</b></p>
          <p>The Serre spectral sequence can be constructed by choosing a cell structure on the base space, and looking at the induced filtration on the total space.  In the case of the Hopf fibration $p: S^3 \to S^2$, and making use of the easy cell structure on S^2 with only two cells, we obtain the following filtration:</p>
          <p>$X_k = \emptyset$ for $k \leq 0$</p>
          <p>$X_0 = X_1 = S^1$</p>
          <p>$X_k = S^3$ for $k \geq 2$</p>
          <p>The homology exact couple of a filtered space is built from the various long exact sequences associated to the pairs $(X_p , X_{p-1})$.</p>
          <p>Its first page is the relative homology, and its first auxiliary is the (absolute) homology.  The variables act as follows:</p>
          <p>$f : H_n X_p \to H_n X_{p+1}$</p>
          <p>$e : H_n X_p \to H_n(X_p , X_{p-1})$</p>
          <p>$e : H_n(X_p , X_{p-1}) \to  H_{n-1} X_{p-1}$,</p>
          <p>where this last map is the usual connecting homomorphism.  In our example, the most interesting long exact sequence concerns the pair $(S^3,S^1)$.  Since the homology of $S^3$ and $S^1$ are pretty sparse, the homology of the pair is determined by isomorphisms</p>
          <p>$e : H_3 S^3 \to H_3(S^3,S^1)$ since $H_3$ and $H_2$ vanish on $S^1$</p>
          <p>$e : H_2(S^3,S^1) \to H_1 S^1$ since $H_2$ and $H_1$ vanish on $S^3$</p>
          <p>$H_1(S^3,S^1) = 0$ since $H_1 S^3 = 0$ and $H_0 S^1 \to H_0 S^3$ is an injection</p>
          <p>$H_0(S^3,S^1) = 0$ since $H_0 S^1 \to H_0 S^3$ is a surjection.</p>
          <p>This analysis shows that the four groups $H_0 X_0$, $H_1 X_0$, $H_2(X_2, X_1)$, and $H_3 X_2$ are free abelian of rank one. Let $x \in H_0 X_0$, $y \in H_1 X_0$, $z \in H_2(X_2,X_1)$, and $w \in H_3 X_2$ be generating classes for these groups.</p>
          <p>By the general properties of exact couples, we have that $e^2$ annihilates auxiliary generators and $f$ annihilates page generators.  It turns out that the only remaining relation in the exact couple is $e*z - f*y$, which says that the connecting map $H_2(X_2,X_1) \to H_1(X_1)$ sends $z$ to the same place as the filtration map $H_1(X_0) \to H_1(X_1)$ sends $y$.  (Depending on your choices for generators, this relation may read $e*z + f*y$.)</p>
          <p>It is straightforward to give all this information to M2, but determining degrees does take a bit of thought the first time you do it.  We continue the example by <b>analyzing degrees ...</b></p>
          <p>Since we have specific degree preferences (exactly double the usual ones for a Serre spectral sequence) we will do this by hand rather than relying on the default degrees provided by <a title="builds a couple ring" href="_couple__Ring.html">coupleRing</a>.</p>
          <p>The usual Serre spectral sequence has $E^1_{pq} = H_{p+q}(X_p , X_{p-1})$, so we place this module in degree $(2p,2q)$.  The module $A^1_{pq} = H_{p+q} X_p$ sits halfway along the map $E^1_{pq} \to E^1_{(p-1)q}$, so it has degree $(2p-1,2q)$.</p>
          <p>In usual indexing, the differential has degree $(-1,0)$, so our differential has degree $(-2,0)$.  On the other hand, since the differential is given by $e^2$, this means that the degree of $e$ itself is $(-1,0)$.  (And in general, the degree of e in our conventions should be the degree of the differential in the usual conventions.)</p>
          <p>Everything so far has been about the first page, $E^1$.  However, the easiest way to determine the degree of $f$ is to consider the second page.  The usual conventions give that the differential on $E^2$ has degree $(-2,1)$, and so (by the same argument as above) this is the degree of $e_2$.  We have generally $deg e_{k+1} = deg e_k - (deg f_k)/2$. Solving, we see that the degree of $f = f_1$ is $2 ((-1,0) - (-2,1)) = (2,-2)$.</p>
          <p>We conclude the general rule that<b>... the degree of e_k in our convention equals the degree of the page-k differential in the standard convention; the degree of f_k is then given by  * (deg e_k - deg e_{k+1})$.</b></p>
          <p>We are now able to set up the couple ring.</p>

        <table class="examples">

        </table>
        <div>
          <p>Now it is time to build the couple.  We give our couple ring to the function <a title="initializes generating classes for an exact couple" href="_declare__Couple.html">declareCouple</a>, together with names and degrees for our generating classes.  The page generators are always given first, and the auxiliary generators second.</p>

          <p>The couple we have built is &quot;free&quot; in the sense that the only relations imposed are the tautologous ones that hold in every exact couple (f acts by zero on the page, and e^2 acts by zero on the auxiliary).  To obtain our couple, we must impose the relation $e*z-f*y$.</p>
