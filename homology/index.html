<h1>Interactive homology calculator</h1>
<p>
Homology is a tool that helps mathematicians reason about complicated spaces.  It detects
if two points in a space can be connected by a path, or if a loop can be filled by a disk.  Its generalizations
have influenced a large fraction of modern mathematics.
</p>
<!-- I1 illustration of points connected by a path and loops with/without a filler -->

<p>
This calculator uses simplicial homology, an enjoyable and concrete theory.  We intentionally skip certain details
in order to limit the required background.  (I already know simplicial homology; please take me to the
<a href="#les">long exact sequence calculator</a>.)
</p>
<h2>Simplicial Complexes</h2>
<p>
An "abstract simplicial complex" on the vertex set \(V = \{0, \ldots, n\}\) is a collection \(\mathcal{F}\)
of subsets of \(V\) called "faces" with the requirement that every subset of a face is also a face.
</p>

<p>
A "subcomplex" \( A \subseteq X \) is an abstract simplicial complex so that every face of \(A\) is also a face of
\(X\).  When we want to talk about a complex and subcomplex simultaneously,
we call them a "pair" and write \( (X, A) \).
</p>

<!-- I2 pair -->
<img src="images/I2.png" alt="a subcomplex inside a larger simplicial complex">
<p>
Abstract simplicial complexes are simple to describe to a computer, for example, by giving a list of maximal faces.
</p>
<!-- P1 demonstration of faces from facets -->

<div class="interactive">

</div>

<p>
When humans reason about abstract simplicial complexes, they often imagine a
geometric subset \(|X| \subset \mathbb{R}^{n + 1}\).  A point belongs to the subset
if its coordinates are nonnegative, sum to one, and attain strictly positive values only on indices constituting a
face of \(X\).
</p>
<!-- E2 geometric realization definition -->
<img src="images/E2.png" alt="symbolic definition of geometric realization">
<p>
Once an abstract simplicial complex has been realized in this way, we drop the adjective "abstract."  All of the 
illustrations on the page are of realized simplicial complexes.  (They look smooth and blobby, but if you zoom
in far enough you will see the triangulations.)  Also, they are rendered as if they are (2d-projections of) 3d
spaces, even though they are actually carefully chosen projections of \(n+1\)-dimensional spaces.
</p>
<p>
Strictly speaking, this calculator doesn't know or need to know anything about this geometry, but
humans sometimes like to keep it in mind.
</p>
<h2>The boundary of a face</h2>
<p>
If we allow every subset of \(V\) to be a face, we obtain the "\(n\)-simplex."  The geometric realization of this
abstract simplicial complex is all vectors with entries that are nonnegative and that sum to one.  Most points in this
space are positive in every coordinate.  If we imagine a journey starting at such a point, we can travel through the
space allowing various coordinates to increase and decrease, as long as the total sum remains exactly one at all times.
</p>
<!-- I3 coordinates on the 2-simplex and boundary points -->
<img src="images/I3.png" alt="formula for the boundary of a simplex">
<p>
It is easy to tell when you reach the edge of the space: one or more of your coordinates will
drop to zero.  You will then be on the face that omits the vertices corresponding to the coordinates that are zero.
So the boundary faces of the \(n\)-simplex are those subsets of \(V\) that omit at least one vertex.
It turns out that we want to take an alternating sum of these faces to obtain the "algebraic" boundary, and
that the coefficients of all faces that omit multiple vertices will be zero.
</p>

<!-- E3 formula for the boundary -->
<img src="images/E3.png" alt="formula for the boundary of a simplex">

<p>
  For example the boundary of a one-simplex (a.k.a. interval) is given by
</p>
  <!-- E4 formula for boundary of an 1-simplex -->

<p>
  Note that the signs here agree with the signs in the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</p>
<!-- E5 fundamental theorem of calculus-->
<img src="images/E5.png" alt="fundamental theorem of calculus">
<p>
  The boundary of a two-simplex (a.k.a. triangle) is given by
</p>
<!-- E6 formula for the boundary of a two-simplex -->
<img src="images/E6.png" alt="formula for the boundary of a 2-simplex">
<p>
More generally, the signs match those arising in Stokes' theorem.
<p>
  <h3>Remark about ordering of the vertices.</h3>  The formula cares about the order of the vertices!  We have chosen to always
  use increasing order, but there is a geometry argument that works here to show that reversing the order of two
  vertices should introduce a minus sign.  (Roughly, this comes from the negation of signed volume under
  reflection, or
  even more concretely, the sign-flipping of one-dimensional integrals under endpoint swapping.)
</p>
<!-- E7 endpoint swap introduces sign -->
<img src="images/E7.png" alt="swapping the endpoints of an integral introduces a sign">
<p>
<h3>Remark about adding and subtracting faces.</h3>  Why are we suddenly allowing ourselves to add and subtract faces?
  Maybe we're planning to integrate (as in Stokes' theorem)
or otherwise convert faces to numbers, at which point the adding and subtracting will make sense; or maybe we just
want to have some fun.
</p>
<h2>Chains</h2>
<p>
  We now hereby allow addition and subtraction of faces.  The resulting objects will be sums of faces with integer
  coefficients.
  Let us call one of these integer combinations a "chain." Every face becomes a chain with a single term with implicit coefficient
  coefficient \( 1 \in \mathbb{Z}\).  Extend the boundary map
to general chains by the rules \( \partial(x + y) = \partial(x) + \partial(y) \) and \( \partial(kx) = k \partial(x) \)
for chains \(x, y\) and integers \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\).  Faces with coefficient zero can be canceled.
</p>
<p>
  A chain on a pair \( (X, A) \) is an integer combination of faces of \(X\).  Two chains on \( (X, A) \) are considered
  equal if their coefficients disagree only on faces of \(A\).  If \(A\) is empty, then two chains must match perfectly
  to be considered equal.
</p>

<!-- P2 interactive calculator: boundary of a chain -->

<h2>Cycles</h2>
<p>
A cycle on a pair \( (X, A) \) is a chain on \(X\) whose boundary is a chain on \(A\).  If \(A\) is empty, the boundary
must be zero.
</p>
<!-- I4 illustration of a cycle -->

<h2>Boundaries</h2>
A boundary on a pair \( (X, A) \) is a chain on \(X\) that can be written as the boundary of another chain on \(X\)
plus some error chain on \(A\).  If \(A\) is empty, then this error is forced to be zero.

<h2>Every boundary is a cycle</h2>
<p>
It is a beautiful fact that every boundary is a cycle.  Consequently, producing
boundaries is as easy as applying \( \partial \) to an arbitrary chain, which gives a ready supply of cheap cycles.
The cycles that are not boundaries are more mysterious.
</p>

<h2>Homology</h2>
<p>
Two cycles are said to be homologous if their difference is a boundary.
</p>
<!-- I6 illustration of two homologous cycles -->
<img src="images/I6.png" alt="two homologous cycles">
<p>
The collection of all cycles that are homologous
to a given cycle \(z\) is called the homology class of \(z\) and written \( [z] \).  The cycle \(z\) is then
called a "representative" for \( [z] \).  Cycles that differ from \( z \) by a boundary are also representatives
for its class:
\( [z] = [z + \partial c] \) for any chain \(c\).  Note that the class of zero \( [0] \) is just the collection of
all boundaries.  We may add homology classes by the rule
\( [z] + [z'] = [z + z'] \).
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to have a cycle \( [z] \neq [0] \) but have \( k[z] = [kz] = [0] \) for some positive integer
  \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\).  This situation is very cool to try to visualize.  Probably the simplest example takes
  \(X\) to be the Mobius band, and \(A\) to be its boundary.  A path cutting across the band is a cycle, since its
  endpoints are on the boundary.  There's no way to get this path as a boundary.  Usually to cancel a path, you would
  add a nearby opposite path or subtract a nearby parallel path.  But this path can cancel itself!  Its double bounds.

<h2>Finding a standard representative for each homology class</h2>
<p>
Suppose given a pair \( (X, A) \).  What information would we like from the computer in order to help us understand
homology?
</p>

<p>
  Here is one setup.  We could ask for a sequence of chains \(f_0, \ldots, f_{b-1}\) so that the boundaries

  \[
  \partial f_0, \ldots, \partial f_{b-1}
  \]

  give a basis for all boundaries.  (A basis is a set over which any element expands uniquely as a sum
  with integer coefficients.)

  And we could ask for a similar, but possibly longer, sequence of cycles giving a basis for the set of all cycles

  \[
   g_0, \ldots,  g_{b+h-1}
  \]

  subject to equations
  \[
  d_i g_i = \partial f_i
  \]
  for all \(0 \leq i < b\), and some divisor chain of integers \(d_0 | d_1 | \cdots | d_{b-1}\).
</p>
<!-- P7 interactive get this data for a pair fillers, cycles, elementary_divisors -->

  <div id="P7-output" class="interactive-output hidden"></div>
</div>
  <p>
    Then, the standard form for a cycle works like this.  First, write the cycle in the basis provided by the \(g_j\).
    Then, use the equations to try to make the coefficients of the g's as small as possible.  For \(j \geq b\),
    there is no equation available, so these coefficients are stuck.  But for \(i < b\), you can use the equations to
    force the coefficient of \(g_j\) to be in the list \( 0, \ldots, d_i - 1\).
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of this procedure, the coefficients of the \(g_j\) provide a standard representative in the same
    homology class as your original cycle, and the remaining terms provide a formula for the error term, which is
    manifestly a boundary.

</div>
<p>
  Usually the divisor chain starts with a bunch of ones.  As one divides every number, the corresponding coefficients
  can be made zero.  This makes the first few \(g\)'s pretty useless for generating homology, so we omit them from now
  on.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of all homology classes for a pair is called a "homology group."  After choosing coordinates as above,
  an element of a homology group can be written as an integer vector.  Each coordinate is only well-defined up to addition
  of integer multiples of its corresponding elementary divisor.  When these are zero, no equivalence relation is imposed,
  and when they are one, we drop the term; when they exceed one, we let them live in the notation as denominators.  For
  example, if the divisor chain is \(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 12, 36, 0, 0 \) then the corresponding homology group is written
  \[
  (\mathbb{Z}/2) \oplus (\mathbb{Z}/4)^{\oplus 2} \oplus (\mathbb{Z}/12) \oplus (\mathbb{Z}/36) \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{\oplus 2}
  \]
  and standard form requires that the first entry be in the range 0-1, the next two entries 0-3, the next 0-11, the next
  0-35, and the last two arbitrary.
</p>
  <h2>The long exact sequence of a pair</h2>
<p>
  Write \(H(X, A)\) for the set of homology classes of the pair \((X, A)\), and write \(\emptyset \) for the empty
subcomplex of \(X\).

There are three easy additive maps relating \(H(X, A)\), \(H(X, \emptyset)\), and \(H(A, \emptyset)\).  First,
\[
\alpha \colon H(A, \emptyset) \to H(X, \emptyset)
\]
which takes cycles on \(A\) and considers them to be cycles on \(X\).  Next,
\[
\beta \colon H(X, \emptyset) \to H(X, A)
\]
which takes cycles on \(X\) and stops caring about the coefficients of faces in \(A\).  Finally,
\[
\gamma \colon H(X, A) \to H(A, \emptyset)
\]
which takes the boundary of cycles on \( (X, A) \) thereby obtaining cycles on \(A\).  These three maps form a triangle
  in that each outputs a class that can be used as input for the next.

It is important--and not obvious--that these maps are well-defined (return homologous outputs when evaluated on
homologous inputs).
</p>
<p>
In fact, these three maps form an "exact sequence."
There are two parts to exactness.
First, the output of one map is always sent to the zero homology class by the next map.  And second, if a homology
class is sent to the zero class by one map, then it actually does arise as an output from the previous.
